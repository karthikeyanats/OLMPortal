To find the focal length of a convex mirror using a convex lens of known focal length.
1. A convex lens of known focal length (say f' =15cm) is taken..
2. The convex lens is placed at a distance of 26 cm (2f' - 4)  from the illuminated object.
3. The position of the screen from the convex lens alone is adjusted to get a well defined image of the object. The size of the image is enlarged.
4. The distance between the object and convex lens is measured and entered in the table.
5. The distance between the convex lens and screen is measured and entered in the table.
6. The convex mirror is now placed between the convex lens and the 	screen such that the reflecting side is pointing towards the illuminated 	object.
7. The position of the convex mirror alone is adjusted so that a well defined image is formed by the side of the object itself.
8. The distance between the convex mirror and the screen gives the radius of curvature, R of the convex mirror.
   The value of R is entered in the table.
9. The experiment is repeated by changing the distance between the convex lens and illuminated object as 28 cm and 30 cm. The value of R is determined in each case and entered in the table.
10.The mean value of R is calculated and entered in the table.
11.The focal length of the convex mirror, f  is given by R/2.
