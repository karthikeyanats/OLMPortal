<![CDATA[
1.The focal length of a convex mirror is determined in this experiment. A convex lens of known focal length is used.
2.The convex lens  is used to get a real and enlarged image.
3.The convex mirror is introduced between the screen and convex lens to get a well defined image by the side of the object.
4.The distance between the screen and convex mirror gives the radius of curvature of the convex mirror
5.The focal length of the convex mirror is obtained by dividing the value of radius of curvature by two.
6.The readings of the metre scale are magnified at required points.
7. The image on the screen is also zoomed and shown separately to make the adjustments easy.
8.Help option suggests what the student has to do next in case he is struck in the process.
8.Audio support to guide the students during the simulation process.
9.Alert message cautions the students when any of his/her action does not fit with the procedure to be followed.
10.Student can record their simulation data using the Record data option.
11.The recorded data can be retrieved at any time using Retrieve data option.
