		<q><![CDATA[1. Convex mirror is used as rear view mirror in cars why?]]></q>
		<a><![CDATA[Convex mirror forms diminished virtual image of the objects. Hence it is used as rear view mirror in cars.]]></a>

		<q><![CDATA[2. Why convex mirror is preferred to plane mirror as rear view mirror even though both of them form virtual image?]]></q>
		<a><![CDATA[Convex mirror is preferred to plane mirror as rear view mirror because it can cover a larger range than plane mirror.]]></a>

		<q><![CDATA[3. An object is placed between F and 2F of the convex mirror. What is the position, nature and size of the image formed?]]></q>
		<a><![CDATA[A convex mirror forms only diminished virtual image for all positions of objects in front of the mirror. Hence a diminished virtual image is formed behind the mirror.]]></a>

		<q><![CDATA[4. There are two mirrors forming enlarged and diminished virtual images respectively. Which one is convex?]]></q>
		<a><![CDATA[The mirror that forms diminished virtual image is convex mirror.]]></a>

		<q><![CDATA[5. What is the relation between focal length and radius of curvature for convex mirror?]]></q>
		<a><![CDATA[Radius of the curvature of the mirror = 2 x focal length]]></a>
