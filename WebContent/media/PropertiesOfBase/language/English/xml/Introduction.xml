<b>Objective:</b><br>
To study the properties of base by its reaction with<br>
1.Litmus solution (Blue and Red)<br>
2.Zinc metal<br>
3.Hydrochloric acid<br><br>
The base given is sodium hydroxide.You are supposed to do all the tests.The experiment column will be displayed in the notepad and for the observation and inference, you have to select the correct options by observing the results.<br>
<b>Introduction</b><br>
Bases are soapy, slippery and usually characterized by its bitter taste. Bases change red litmus blue. Concentrated bases also annihilate body tissues and fatty material. Base exists as electrolytes in solution. It is used as fertilizer, tanning,laxative and antacid.<br>
Common examples for bases: sodium hydroxide,Barium hydroxide, Magnesium hydroxide and Ammonium hydroxide

<Reason>
<reason>
sodium hydroxide base turns blue litmus solution red
</reason>
<reason>
sodium hydroxide base does not affect the red litmus solution
